# Protein-secondary-structure-prediction
This repo is made as a final project for The concordia university (Montr√©al) datascience bootcamp.
I have choosen to try and do a neural networks model for PSSP.
In this repo you will find the following:
Projet1 through 5 exept 4 : they are ipynb files made in a jupyter notebook and containing different model I tried.
app.py : VS code that use streamlit to create a webpage user friendly to use my model.
Protein secondary structure prediction presentation : a powerpoint presenting the whole project.
data.csv: the data set I used to train/test my model.
many kind of saved model (all saved from projet 5)
saved_objects.pkl: the encoding for my input data saved with pickle.
